#### Coding Session - 1

## Learning objectives:
- Using axios to perform HTTP requests 
- Using promises
- Using lifecycle methods in a meaningful way

## Final Goal

The goal of this project is to create a github user search application.

Link to the github API [https://developer.github.com/v3/search/](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/) 

## Minimum Viable Product

MVP or minimum viable product is the least amount of functionality you must have done by the end of today.

- [ ] Users should be able to search for github users.
- [ ] Users should be able to see information about github users like username, profile picture, etc.
- [ ] Users should be able to click any profile to see more information about any given user. (This must occur within your app itself, not link externally to github.com! You can still provide an externaly link if required.) 

## Stretch Goals

If you are able to complete the MVP in time, implement this additional functionality. 
This must be completed within the end of the next day.

- [ ] Use the API to also implement repository search.
- [ ] Allow users to search repositories by programming language.
- [ ] Use any UI framework and/or CSS to make your application presentable.
