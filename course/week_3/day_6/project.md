7. Chess
   

**COMPLEXITY LEVELS (POSSIBILITIES)**

1. Basic ability for two players to play 
2. Ask for the names of the players and show whose turn it is to play
3. Show any invalid operations or when the game ends

Feel free to add more features or options

**RULES**

- Write clean code and follow good naming convention

- All the javascript should be written in a seperate javascript file (See HINT below)

- You can use any of the things covered in the classes from Week 1 to Week 3

- The only inbuilt functions or properties of javascript variables you can use are `array.length` `string.length` `array.pop()` `array.push()` or the `random` function incase it is needed

  ```javascript
  function random(number){
    return Math.floor(Math.random()*number);
  }
  ```

- You can use any of the events & DOM manipulations

- For some of the projects you can create the arrays with initial values you wanted


HINT: How to use a separate `css` file and `js` file

```html
<head>
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
	<script src="script.js"></script>
</body>
```

**HINTS**

- Remember the UNIX Philosophy
  - Make each program do one thing well. To do a new job, build afresh rather than complicate old programs by adding new features.
  - Expect the output of every program to become the input to another, as yet unknown, program. Don't clutter output with extraneous information. Avoid stringently columnar or binary input formats. Don't insist on interactive input.
  - Design and build software, even operating systems, to be tried early, ideally within weeks. Don't hesitate to throw away the clumsy parts and rebuild them.
  - Use tools in preference to unskilled help to lighten a programming task, even if you have to detour to build the tools and expect to throw some of them out after you've finished using them.
- For all the projects you need to work mostly on array manipulations so you can refer to the below codepen for help https://codepen.io/nrupuld/pen/dybNEWJ?editors=1011
