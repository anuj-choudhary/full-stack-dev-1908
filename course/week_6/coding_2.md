**SUBMISSION:**
- Create the files into the location `~/repos/cohort_2/submissions/<your_folder>/week_6/day_1/session_2/` 
- Push the file  back to the online repo


#### Coding Session 2 A

Create the following files
- index.html
- index.js

Using HTML:
Make a page that will take input from a user of a Car:
Car make, Model, Top Speed.
Use a form to submit the information to create a new class with the details which is given in the next section.
Create one more input form where you can select your Car which will take the details of a ride, time and speed.
You should have one more button for showing current status of the car which will return the information of the car and the total distance travelled so far.
You should also be able to view all the details of Cars that you have inputted so far.


Create a class `Car`:
It should have the following variables: use the names as per given
1. carMake - will contain the Car company
2. model - will contain info of the model
3. topSpeed - top speed in km/hr
4. dist - total distance travelled by the car
It should have the following functions:
1. `Constructor` - Take car_make, model and top_speed and initialise while creating new Class. Fill it with invalid for wrong inputs for strings and for numbers fill with 0 if not defined. dist is initialised as 0.

2. `travelDist`(time,speed) - it should take distance travelled by the car and at what speed as arguments, if not defined, then time will be given default value of 1 hour, and speed is given as half of top speed. The function calculates the distance travelled and updates the distance and returns the value of the distance.

3. `presentStatus` - This will return all the variables as string in the same line with one space between each. Give units as per value
    example `Honda CRV-05 110km/hr 120km`
HTML:
   

#### Coding Session 2 B

Create a class `Student`:
It should have the following variables: use the names as per given
1. name - name of student
2. email - email of student
3. phone - phone no

It should have the following functions:
1. `Constructor` - Take name, email and phone as input arguments and fill it with invalid if no argument is passed. 

2. `assignMarks`(args) this function should take multiple inputs, and assign all of this into a variable marks in the class.

3. `highestMarks` this function checks highest mark and returns the value

4. `totalSubjects` this function returns total no of subjects as response.

5. `showMarks` this function returns the marks as an array.

6. `average` returns the average of the marks

6. `low` will return the lowest marks 

Please follow the names and instructions strictly. 


**SUBMISSION:**
- Create a new file and copy these two questions into it, and write your answers into that. 
- Explain the answer as well.


10. What is the value of `a`, `b`, `c`?
```javascript

class Room{
    constructor(l = 0,b = 0, h = 0,t = 0 ){
        this.len  = l;
        this.br   = b;
        this.ht   = h;
        this.tempC = t;
    }
    toKelvinFromCelsius( a = 0){
        this.tempC =  this.tempC || a
        return this.tempC+273.15;
    }
    toFarFromCelsius(){

    }
}

s1 = new Room(10,10,10)

c =s1.toKelvinFromCelsius()
a = s1.toKelvinFromCelsius(100)
b = s1.toKelvinFromCelsius(200)

```
Answer

```

```
11. What is the output from the following program
```javascript
const x = (...x) => x.reduce((a,b)=>a+b)/x.length
y = x(10,20,30)
console.log(`Hey ${x(10)} + 00010010 is = ${y}`)
```
Answer

```

```
