#### Coding 2


**SUBMISSION:**

- Make a react app with the name `router-project` with your first name and last name  
- **Make sure to include this MarkDown file in your submission with checked boxes for all parts you have completed.**

**React Router 1**


**NOTE:** Follow the instructions carefully and follow coding discipline

**NOTE2:** Indent your code correctly and stick to one kind of naming style

**NOTE3:** All components must be in different files and within a `Components`folder. CSS can be shared between components if desired. CSS modules must also be in your components folder. 

**NOTE4:** All static files like images must be in the public folder.

**NOTE5:** All components files must have the same name as their components. Eg: `App` must be in `App.js`.

**NOTE6:** You must only call `ReactDOM.render` once in your index.js file! 

**NOTE7**: Commit your code to your remote branch regularly and meaningfully.(Don't commit to master!) This can help you manage your project during development in case you need to return to any old code. 

**NOTE**: Do not write all your code within a single component!

Within the react App delete all files from the src folder and create your own files!

## Learning objectives:
- Basic Routing with React Router
- Building a Scalable Application

## Final Goal

This will be a multi-part project spanning across the next few days. Your final objective will be to create a mock E-Commerce website similar to these [https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-stores](https://www.shopify.com/blog/shopify-stores).

As we continue to learn more about React Router should be implementing new features. 

For inspiration on your design take a look at these websites:

-  [https://www.tannergoods.com/](https://www.tannergoods.com/)
- [https://hauslondon.com/](https://hauslondon.com/)
- [https://www.studioproper.com/](https://www.studioproper.com/)
- [https://www.apple.com/](https://www.apple.com/)


## Minimum Viable Product

MVP or minimum viable product is the least amount of functionality you must have done by the end of today.

Pick a group of products you like and create a website around selling that line of products. 

Examples: Clothes, paintings, electronics etc. Be creative!

The pages you design do not have to contain content right now. However they should still render different components.

**The following should be common for every page of your application:**

- [ ] Your website must contain a navigation bar with links to different product categories and other pages.
- [ ] Your website must contain a banner at the very top advertising an ongoing deal or coupon code.
- [ ] You website must contain a footer with some social media icons and some links for FAQ, Job opportunities etc.
- [ ] A Shopping Cart Icon on your navigation bar. This does not have to do anything for now.

**The following are routes/pages you must have:**
- [ ] Products categories depending on the kind of product you have. Eg: A clothing store would have Mens, Womens, Unisex etc. It is up to you.
- [ ] About Us Page.
- [ ] FAQ page.
- [ ] Contact Us page.
